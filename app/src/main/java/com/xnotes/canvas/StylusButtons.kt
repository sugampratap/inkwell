/**
 * Whether a stylus side button is currently down.
 *
 * Pens do not agree on how to report this, and getting it right took several releases of
 * device-specific work, so the infinite canvas latches it through this rather than working it out
 * again. Three delivery routes are covered:
 *
 *  - the touch stream's `buttonState`, which most pens use;
 *  - the hovering generic-motion stream, for pens that report the button only while hovering and
 *    never in a touch event;
 *  - a `KeyEvent`, which Bluetooth and USI pens use, including one vendor code with no standard
 *    mapping ([InteractionController.VENDOR_HELD_BUTTON_KEYCODE]).
 *
 * A fourth quirk is handled higher up and needs nothing here: some Samsung builds tag a
 * button-held stroke with proprietary action codes instead of DOWN/MOVE/UP, and `MainActivity`
 * rewrites those before dispatch, so any view in the tree gets a normal touch stream.
 *
 * The button masks and the vendor keycode are read from [InteractionController] rather than copied,
 * so the two canvases cannot drift apart on which buttons count.
