/**
 * Remembers when each note/folder was created, keyed by document identity (the same
 * authority+id key as [ViewStateStore] and the explorer's per-note view), so the
 * grid can order by creation rather than last-modified. The Storage Access Framework
 * exposes only a last-modified time, never a creation time, so the app tracks it
 * itself: an item the app creates, and any item it later *discovers* under the granted
 * folder, is stamped the first time it's seen ([stampMissing]) with the earlier of then and
 * its modified time, and keeps that stamp until the file's own record replaces it ([put]).
 * Held in memory and mirrored to a small JSON file ([JsonStore.createdTimes]); [clear]ed
 * when the user forgets the folder, since the keys are only meaningful for it.
