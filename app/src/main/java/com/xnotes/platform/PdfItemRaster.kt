/**
 * The part of a PDF export that cannot stay vector.
 *
 * [PdfBoxRenderer] turns plain ink, shapes, images and text into real PDF objects, but a few looks
 * have no vector equivalent (a neon glow, the highlighter's multiply blend, translucent ink, the
 * pencil's paper grain), so
 * those are drawn into a bitmap cropped to their own box and dropped back in at the right z-order.
 *
 * Shared by the paged [PdfExporter] and [CanvasPdfExporter] rather than written twice, so the two can
 * never disagree about which items those are: the same stroke vectorized on one surface and
 * rasterized on the other would export the same drawing two different ways.
