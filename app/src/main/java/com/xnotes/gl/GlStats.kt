/**
 * A snapshot of what the render thread just did, for the debug HUD. Written on the GL thread and
 * read on the main thread, so it is one immutable value swapped wholesale rather than a set of
 * fields that could be read half updated.
 *
 * The GL canvas has failure modes the paged one does not: buffers that grow without bound, an EGL
 * context silently rebuilt, a cull that stops culling, a draw-call count that quietly climbs as the
 * geometry buffer fragments. All of those are invisible until something is slow or wrong, so they
 * are all here.
