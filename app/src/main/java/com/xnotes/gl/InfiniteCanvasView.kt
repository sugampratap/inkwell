/**
 * The on-screen infinite canvas: a [GLSurfaceView] driving [GlRenderer].
 *
 * Nothing here is rasterized at a fixed resolution, so there is no cache to be at the wrong scale
 * and no settle-and-rebuild after a pinch. Zoom and scroll reach the shader as uniforms, which is
 * what makes the view sharp during a gesture rather than after it.
 *
 * Rendering is [RENDERMODE_WHEN_DIRTY]: the canvas repaints on interaction, like the paged one,
 * not at the display refresh rate. If stylus latency proves worse than the paged `View` path, the
 * swap to an owned EGL context on a dedicated render thread is confined to this file.
 *
 * The input hooks deliberately mirror `canvas.CanvasView`'s, so the same interaction layer and the
 * same hard-won device-specific stylus handling drive either canvas.

     * good trade while panning, where evenness is the whole of the feel, and a bad one while
     * inking, where the gap between the nib and the line is. So this is turned on for pan, pinch
