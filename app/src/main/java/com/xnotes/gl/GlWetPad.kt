/**
 * The surface wet ink is drawn into while the pen is down, in the buffer the panel is scanning out.
 *
 * This is a real front buffer, not a layer the compositor latches: `EGL_KHR_mutable_render_buffer`
 * lets an ordinary window surface be switched to `EGL_SINGLE_BUFFER` at run time, after which GL
 * commands land in the buffer being displayed and a `glFlush` is the whole publish step. There is
 * no queue, no fence handed to SurfaceFlinger and no waiting for a refresh boundary, which is what
 * separates this from every "low latency" wrapper that still posts and latches.
 *
 * It has to be a surface of its own because no multisampled config on this device carries the
 * mutable bit, and the canvas is not giving up its antialiasing. Ink quality comes back in
 * [GlWetPadInk], which draws into a small multisampled buffer and resolves the damage into here.
 * On Android 12 and later that surface is a layer of the pad's own: see [openLayer].
 *
 * ### Threads
 *
 * Everything EGL and GL belongs to [thread]. The main thread posts messages and reads nothing.
