/**
 * The two offscreen buffers a neon bloom is built in: geometry into one, blurred across into the
 * other, blurred down and back.
 *
 * They are kept at a fraction of the viewport. A Gaussian wide enough to read as a halo costs a lot
 * of taps at full resolution, and a blur is exactly the operation that hides the resolution it was
 * computed at, so half size is free quality-wise and a quarter of the fill.
 *
 * Like everything else GPU resident, these die with the EGL context and are rebuilt from nothing.

     *
     * The dragged selection needs its own because a drag moves it and leaves the rest alone; a blur
     * is translation invariant, so its layer is built once and then composited at an offset.
