/**
 * One eraser drag, from pen down to pen up.
 *
 * Both modes reduce to the same shape: an item is swapped for whatever survives it, which is
 * nothing at all in whole-item mode and the surviving fragments in area mode. That gives one undo
 * command for both, and one argument for why it is correct.
 *
 * The work per step is bounded by what the eraser is over, not by the size of the canvas: the
 * spatial index narrows the document to the items under the circle, and the record keeps only the
 * ones actually cut. The paged canvas can afford to snapshot its whole page list per gesture; here
 * the page is the entire document, so it cannot.
 *
 * A fragment can be cut again later in the same drag, so entries are coalesced as it runs: each
 * holds the item as it was at pen down and the fragments left at pen up, never the states between.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin, so the whole of the eraser's behaviour is unit-testable without a canvas.
