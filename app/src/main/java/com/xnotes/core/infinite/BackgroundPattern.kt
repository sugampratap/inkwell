/**
 * Scale selection and phase for the infinite canvas ruling. The pattern is drawn procedurally in a
 * fragment shader rather than as geometry, so all the shader needs is a period and an offset, both
 * already in device pixels. That is what this computes.
 *
 * Two things make it more than a division. First, a fixed content-space period would be a hair-thin
 * blur zoomed out and a single line zoomed in, so the period doubles or halves in powers of two
 * until it lands in a comfortable on-screen band, and the finer of the two neighbouring levels
 * fades in as it becomes legible. Second, the shader works in float, and at extreme scroll offsets
 * a content coordinate does not survive that; but a periodic pattern only ever needs
 * `scroll mod period`, which stays small and is computed here in double.
