/**
 * What is selected on the canvas, and the arithmetic of moving, scaling and rotating it.
 *
 * A live drag restores each item's gesture-start geometry and re-applies the whole transform every
 * frame, rather than applying an incremental one. That is what keeps a drag from compounding
 * rounding error, and it is what lets a rotation be undone as a single step.
 *
 * The box is oriented rather than axis-aligned, so a selection that has been turned keeps its own
 * frame and its handles scale along its own axes. Both come from [ResizeMath], shared with the
 * paged canvas, so a resize behaves the same on either surface.
 *
 * Pure Kotlin: no view, no renderer, so all of it unit-tests.
