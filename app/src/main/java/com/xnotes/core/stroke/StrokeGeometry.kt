 * heap several-fold (floats are far past render precision; the renderer draws in floats anyway).
 * The ink is painted by sweeping a brush disc down the [centerline] at the per-point [halfWidths]
 * (Renderer.fillDiskRibbon), so caps and joins round on every pen. Compared by identity (a rebuild
 * is a new instance), like the model items.
 *
 * The ribbon's two edges are stored as [leftRail] and [rightRail], each in centreline order, and
 * the closed polygon the neon bloom fills is derived from them by [outline]. Storing the rails and
 * not the polygon is what lets a live stroke *grow*: the polygon is the left rail followed by the
 * right one reversed, so its second half shifts by one slot every time a sample lands, while the
 * rails only ever gain an entry at the end. [outline] is built once, on the first caller that
 * genuinely needs a packed ring, so ordinary ink never pays for it. Nothing needs both:
 * [WetRibbon] grows the rails, and the neon painter reads the ring.
