/**
 * The ribbon of a stroke still under the pen, grown a sample at a time instead of rebuilt.
 *
 * [StrokeEngine.build] is a batch: every sample re-runs a dozen passes over the whole stroke and
 * allocates a dozen arrays to hold them, so the cost of one frame of ink is proportional to how
 * much ink is already down. Written slowly, a long stroke ends up re-deriving thousands of points
 * to draw the one under the nib, and the line starts trailing the hand.
 *
 * It does not have to. Almost every rule the engine applies is **causal**: the arc-length low-pass
 * ([StrokeEngine.emaByArc]) and the nib's slew limiter ([StrokeEngine.nibStep]) each read one
 * sample and their own previous output, so their answer for a point is fixed the moment that point
 * arrives. What is left looks a bounded distance ahead, and that distance is what this class
 * tracks: [settledCount] is how many leading points can no longer change, whatever the writer does
 * next. Points behind it are computed once and kept. Points in front are the only ones recomputed,
 * and there are never many of them.
 *
 * What holds a point back:
 *  - its **tangent**, a central difference, so the last point is always provisional;
 *  - the **end-pressure hold** ([StrokeEngine.heldPressureAt]), whose window sits over the last
 *    [StrokeEngine.CAP_HOLD_SAMPLES] points and moves with them;
 *  - the **speed** pen's centred window, which reads [StrokeEngine.SPEED_WINDOW_MS] ahead in time;
 *  - the **calligraphy** head, which pins every point flat until the stroke first fills
 *    [StrokeEngine.HEAD_LEN] and then rewrites them once.
 *
 * A revision-1 taper pen settles nothing: its profile is a fraction of the *total* arc, so every
 * point it has ever drawn moves each time the stroke gets longer, and [supports] turns it down. The
 * brush that replaced it ([StrokeEngine.brushTaperFactors]) eases its head over a fixed travel and
 * leaves its tail to the lift, so it grows like any other pen. The revision-2 quill reads its speed
 * looking back only ([StrokeEngine.trailingSpeedFactors]), so it settles as it lands.
 *
 * The output is exactly what [StrokeEngine.build] returns for the same samples with
 * `finished = false`, point for point, which the tests hold it to. Lift-time rules (the calligraphy
 * dot and its tail cap) are not modelled here at all: they only fire once the pen is up, and the
 * stroke rebuilds through [StrokeEngine.build] then.
