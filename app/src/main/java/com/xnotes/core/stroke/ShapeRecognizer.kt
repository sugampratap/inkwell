/**
 * Classifies a freehand stroke into a clean shape, or `null` when it is not a confident
 * match (the caller then leaves the stroke as ink).
 *
 * Pure and deterministic so it can be unit-tested on the plain JVM, like [StrokeEngine].
 * Works in page-local content px; thresholds are fractions of the stroke's bounding-box
 * diagonal or plain angles, so recognition is scale- (and zoom-) independent.
 *
 * Shapes recognized:
 *  - open straight stroke -> [ShapeKind.LINE]
 *  - open multi-segment zig-zag -> [ShapeKind.POLYLINE] (vertices preserved)
 *  - any other smooth open stroke (a C, an S, ...) -> [ShapeKind.CURVE] (a single fitted cubic
 *    Bézier, sampled to a dense polyline), or left as ink if one cubic can't follow it
 *  - closed round blob -> [ShapeKind.ELLIPSE] (snapped to a circle when nearly round)
 *  - closed n-gon with sharp corners -> [ShapeKind.RECTANGLE] when it is an upright box,
 *    else [ShapeKind.POLYGON] (vertices preserved, including 3-corner triangles)
 *
 * Corners drive the closed-shape decision: a smooth outline (no sharp turns) is the only
 * thing that becomes an ellipse, so a hexagon stays a polygon and a circle never does. Corners are
 * read over a window a twelfth of the path long, which a short edge (the end of a long thin
 * rectangle) fits inside, hiding its two corners as one; a stroke that matches nothing is therefore
 * read again on a denser resample at tighter windows before it is given up on as ink.
 *
 * A line, and every polygon/polyline edge, that lands within [AXIS_SNAP_DEG] of horizontal or
 * vertical is straightened flat ([snapAxisAligned]), the way a near-round blob squares to a circle.
