/**
 * The unit of inking (spec 02 §5.1). Holds the raw samples plus a snapshot of
 * the tool style; the ribbon geometry is derived from the samples on demand and
 * cached until the samples change.
 *
 * Samples live in parallel primitive arrays, not a `List<Sample>`: a dense note holds millions of
 * them, and one boxed 4-double object per sample costs ~60 bytes against the 12 the numbers need.
 * Positions are **offsets from a per-stroke double origin** taken at pen-down, so a float never has
 * to carry a large absolute coordinate — the infinite canvas has no coordinate bound, and float32
 * spacing reaches a whole pixel around 1e7. An offset spans one stroke, a few hundred px at most,
 * where float resolves to ~1e-5 px. [samples] is a read-only view over the arrays for the cold call
 * sites; the hot loops read [xAt]/[yAt]/[pAt] and allocate nothing.
 *
 * The arrays and the count they belong to are held together in one immutable [Samples], swapped
 * whole on every edit, so a stroke can be read from another thread while the pen draws on it.

 * One stroke's samples, frozen: [n] entries of the parallel arrays, positions as offsets from
 * [ox]/[oy]. A [Stroke] never edits a published tuple; it builds a new one and publishes it in a
 * single volatile write, which is what makes a stroke safe to read from another thread while the
 * pen is drawing on it. The autosave writer relies on that: it serializes the live items rather
 * than a deep copy of them, so saving a note no longer costs a second copy of it on the heap.
 *
 * The arrays may be longer than [n] (a live stroke grows by doubling) and are append-only past it:
 * [Stroke.addSample] fills the slack, which no reader looks at, while anything that rewrites an
 * entry that has been published allocates new arrays instead.
