/**
 * A linear undo/redo stack (spec 07 §1). A new edit clears the redo branch.
 * Commands operate on the in-memory model by identity, so item/page references
 * must remain stable across an undo/redo cycle.
 *
 * Bounded at [limit] commands, oldest dropped first. A command holds the model it can put back:
 * [EraseItems] pins every erased stroke and [ReplacePageItems] pins a page's whole item list on
 * each area-eraser drag, so an unbounded stack retains a session's worth of deleted ink. That
 * competes for the heap with everything else and makes whatever allocates next the thing that
 * fails. The redo stack needs no cap of its own: it only ever holds what undo popped.
